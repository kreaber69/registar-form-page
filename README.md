remove .gitattributes and .gitignore
you need to install these libraries (flask , cs50 , flask_mail)
by writting this in your terminal:
      pip install flask cs50 flask-mail

*note*
there is a problem that when the user first register it send two otp to the user e-mail if you can fix it i will be tankful :)
